1.Open your terminal

2.You could firstly just check your current $PATH, type

echo $PATH
to terminal

3.If the $PATH that terminal gave back is the path you want, then you are good; if not, type

export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
, then type

touch ~/.bash_profile
, and then type

open ~/.bash_profile
, you will then find a EditText open up, now type the path you want in that EditText; For instance, type

PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin
(which is the default $PATH for mac, considering you want to reset the $PATH so you should probably type this), save it, and then close EditText, then close Terminal.

4.Now you have already changed your $PATH or reset to the mac's default $PATH!
